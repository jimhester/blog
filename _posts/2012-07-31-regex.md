As a continuation of my [previous](http://jimhester.calepin.co/perl-vs-python-vs-ruby-parsing-fasta-files.html) [posts](http://jimhester.calepin.co/perl-vs-python-vs-ruby-fasta-reading-using-bio-packages.html) comparing the three major scripting languages used in bioinformatics 
I wanted to take a look at the regular expression performance of the three 
languages.  A common use case of regular expressions in bioinformatics is 
searching for restriction enzyme cut sites in a genome of interest.  To 
benchmark this case I downloaded a list of known restriction enzymes from 
REBASE in the [simple bionet format](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.f13.html), then parsed that format and converted it into regular expressions  with the [this code](https://gist.github.com/3217832#file_parse_rebase.pl).

This gives one a list of restriction enzymes and a regular expression for each enzyme, 
which is used as the input for the searching scripts for each language.  To 
test the relative performance I randomly sampled 10 restriction enzymes and 
searched human chromosome 10 for them.  Here are the implementations for each 
language.

### Perl ###
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3217832.js?file=regex.pl"></script>

### Python ###
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3217832.js?file=regex.py"></script>

### Ruby ###
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3217832.js?file=regex.rb"></script>

To sample the enzymes and run them for each language


{% highlight bash %}
sort -R enzymes | head > top
regex.pl top Hg18.fa >> out
regex.py top Hg18.fa >> out
regex.rb top Hg18.fa >> out
{% endhighlight %}

And the results


{% highlight bash %}
perl: 0.4926 secs per enzyme
python: 7.6647 secs per enzyme
ruby:   0.4685 secs per enzyme
{% endhighlight %}

Clearly python's regular expression engine leaves a lot to be desired compared 
to that of perl's and ruby's, with speed more than 15 fold slower.  These 
results are very consistent with repeated runs of different enzymes.  This 
clearly shows a lack of suitability for python to complete this common task.

Addendum: using google's re2 regular expression engine and the [python extension which uses it](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/re2/)
in python brings the performance much closer to the other languages


{% highlight bash %}
python: 0.8421 secs per enzyme
{% endhighlight %}

I cannot easily test the re2 bindings in perl and ruby, the perl package 
requires perl 5.10 or newer, which we do not have installed, and the ruby 
bindings do not implement global matching from what I can tell.  It is not 
a huge issue there however as both languages regex engines are natively fast.
