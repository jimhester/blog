[Docker] has been widely touted in the R community as a way to provide
reproducibility in analysis by explicitly describing system dependencies for a
given project. See [An Introduction to Rocker: Docker Containers for
R](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03675) for details of the project goals and
use-cases. However a different use case than those described in the paper where
docker is also useful is for testing R packages during package development.

Services like [Travis-CI][travis] are an excellent way to run automated checks for a
package on linux environments. However each build takes at least a few minutes
to run, so trying to debug something using only travis can be a time consuming,
frustrating process. Travis has recently introduced a [travis-debug-mode],
which allows ssh access into a build, however for public jobs anyone who is
looking at the build logs has the same access, so it is not really practical to
use.

Docker provides a nice way to setup and run linux environments on a wide
variety of distributions. Because these environments are run
on your local computer you can have a very tight feedback loop, which can make
debugging issues much less time consuming.

## Installing Docker

I use MacOS for my primary development machine, and fortunately there is now a
nice [docker for mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
installer available to install the docker client.

[installation
procedures](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms)
for the windows client are also available and most popular linux distributions
have docker clients in their distributions package manager.

## Docker Containers

Before you can begin using docker, you need to decide what container to use.
Containers are basically a saved set of instructions on how to setup an environment.
Fortunately for R use there are a number of containers already available. In
particular the [rocker] project by Carl Boettiger, Dirk Eddelbuettel, et al.
provides a large set of containers with various configurations. Gábor Csárdi's
[rhub] project also uses docker for it's linux builders which provide a
nice way to replicate environments used to build packages on rhub.

I have found the most useful containers for R package development to be

- [rocker/r-ver](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker#versioned-stack-builds-on-r-ver)
  which provides version specific R on a debian base, e.g. `rocker/r-ver:3.1.0`
  will lets you test on older R versions easily.
- [rocker/r-devel] For using recent versions of R-devel. Note in this image the
  R devel is installed along side the release version of R, you need to access
  it with `RD` instead of `R`.
- [rocker/r-apt](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/tree/master/r-apt), which
  gives you access to a specific ubuntu releases. This lets you test on older
  ubuntu releases such as precise or trusty. These releases are used on travis,
  so using `rocker/r-apt:trusty` will get you a local environment very close to
  what is being run with your travis jobs.
- The [rhub containers](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub-linux-builders) for
  fedora, centos and others with both gcc and clang flavors, e.g `rhub/fedora-gcc`.
- [r-devel-san](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-devel-san/) and
  [r-devel-ubsan-clang](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-devel-ubsan-clang/)
  which build R using [address sanitizers], very helpful for detecting memory
  errors in C/C++ code used in R packages.

## Running docker for development

So once you have picked out what container you want to use how do you actually
go about testing your R package with it? Lets say you have a package on your
local machine at `/a/certain/directory`. What I do is

```shell
# Change to the directory
cd /a/certain/directory

# Start docker in that directory, mapping the current directory to a directory
# in the docker image using the `rocker/r-apt:trusty` container and starting a
# bash prompt in that container.
docker run -v "$(pwd)":"/opt/$(basename $(pwd))" -it rocker/r-apt:trusty /bin/bash
```

Docker will then download the files necessary to start the container, and drop
you into a bash shell. You can then navigate to `/opt/pkgname` and you will be in
your local package directory.

This installs R, but not your package or its dependencies.
One efficient way to do this is to use the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package, which has no
external dependencies, and is useful if you only want to run `R CMD build . &&
R CMD check *tar.gz` to verify building and checking the package works.

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_local(".", dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you want to install a full development environment using
[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools),
[roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) and
[testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) there are a few system
dependencies you need also need to install first.

```shell
apt-get update &&
apt-get install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libssh2-1-dev libxml2-dev
```

devtools does not install `testthat` and `roxygen2` by default, so usually it
is best to install all three at once.

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "testthat", "roxygen2"))
```

You can then use the same workflow in the docker container as you do normally.
You can even continue editing the source files on your local machine using your
normal editor. You just need to build and run the code in the container using
`devtools::load_all()` and `devtools::test()`.

## Additional tips / notes

As noted above the rocker r-devel builds (and sanitizer builds) install R
devel as RD. Make sure you are using that instead of R to run R-devel.

If your package has compiled code and you have been testing it outside of the
docker, you likely have old object files in the `src/` directory. If you then
try to compile it in docker you will get an error `invalid ELF header`
indicating the library was built for the wrong architecture. To fix this clean
the object files using `devtools::clean_dll()` or `rm src/*o` from the shell.

If you want to run [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) within docker you will need to pass
`--security-opt=seccomp:unconfined` to your docker run command, which disables
the security sandboxing used by default in docker and allows you to run
executables under gdb. You also need to install gdb `apt-get install gdb` and
run R with it as the debugger `R -d gdb`.

If you are running the address sanitizers and want to abort on the error (so
you can get a backtrace of the location) you can do so with
`ASAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=1 RD -d gdb`.

If using docker on MacOS the host can be accessed from the container with the
stable ip `192.168.65.1.` This is useful if you have a database or other
service running on the host machine.

## Conclusion

While docker commands are somewhat esoteric, if you use the workflow detailed
in this post docker and the rocker project are invaluable tools for verifying
your package works on a variety of systems and reproducing errors observed by
users.
