I am pleased to announce my project for generating styled, dynamic html reports
[knitr_bootstrap].  Here is an [example] of a report.

I have been using [knitr] to produce reports for around 6 months or so now, first
using [pandoc] to generate the html, lately I have been using the [Rmarkdown] R
package instead.  This has a couple of advantages over [pandoc].  First, it is
much easier to install as anyone who has tried to install [haskell] on CentOS
can attest to.  Secondly, the [Rmarkdown] package is the same one which is used
for [Rstudio].  While I do not use [RStudio] much myself, preferring the power
of [vim], the ease of use and growing ubiquity means that more people can make
use of the package.

The only issue with [Rmarkdown] is the default stylesheet is fairly simplistic,
and the table of contents is not as full featured as the one generated by
[pandoc].  I also would prefer to have plots embedded as thumbnails rather than
full size, with the option to click on them to zoom. It would also be nice to
style the report using [bootstrap], which gives it a much more polished feel.

After a fair amount of work understanding the [jQuery] framework and
[bootstrap], I have gotten the reports feature full enough for others to try.
Current features include

* Automatic table of contents constructed from h1-4 tags using [tocify]
* Output automatically resized to fit the display
* Code/Output block and plot visibility can be toggled with a mouse click
* Images are automatically thumbnailed and lightboxed using [fancybox]
* Code blocks in >50 languages automatically highlighted using [highlight.js]
* Automatically wraps code block with div elements to work with bootstrap
* Can restyle with bootstrap compatible css
* Completely offline report usiing knitr_bootstrap_standalone.html

It does require a [small patch][patch] to the [Rmarkdown] package to work as I am using it,
but it should be an fairly easy to accept, and if not workarounds are possible,
if less elegant.  Please give it a try and let me know your thoughts!
