title: Using a C level debugger in Rstudio

I often use C level debuggers such as [lldb][] and [gdb][] when debugging R
packages with compiled code. If you are unfamiliar with doing this [Kevin Ushey
has an excellent
post](http://kevinushey.github.io/blog/2015/04/13/debugging-with-lldb/) on the topic.
Usually bugs are reproducible both from the R terminal and RStudio. If this is
the case then running R under the debugger is easy; just start R from the
terminal with `R -d lldb`.

However more rarely there will be a bug that only occurs when the code is run
in [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/), and in these cases you would ideally like to
be able to attach to the internal RStudio Rsession process.

You can get the PID (process identifier) of any R process by calling `Sys.getpid()` from the
R console. Then you can have the debugger attach to this PID with the `-p`
argument to lldb, e.g. `lldb -p 45323`. However if you do this with the current
RStudio release (v1.1) you will get this!

I believe this occurs because of how RStudio detects if the R process
is still running. When the debugger interrupts internal rsession process
RStudio no longer thinks it has an active R session running, so shows the error
message.

However you can work around this by using a feature of lldb I hadn't used until
encountering this problem, `--waitfor`. This allows you to have lldb attach to
a process (by name) as soon as it starts.

To do this first start lldb from a separate console (`lldb`). This will launch
you into the lldb prompt. Then tell lldb you would like to attach to the
rsession process using `--waitfor`.

    process attach --name rsession --waitfor

lldb will then wait for this rsession process to start. Now we can start up
RStudio. The lldb session will then print something like the following

```
Process 50879 stopped
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = signal SIGSTOP
    frame #0: 0x000000010085b4f8 rsession`rstudio_boost::filesystem::path::path<char const*>(char const*, char const*) + 88
rsession`rstudio_boost::filesystem::path::path<char const*>:
->  0x10085b4f8 <+88>: movb   %al, (%r13)
    0x10085b4fc <+92>: jmp    0x10085b50c               ; <+108>
    0x10085b4fe <+94>: movq   %r13, %rdi
    0x10085b501 <+97>: movq   %r12, %rsi
Target 0: (rsession) stopped.
```

And the RStudio session will be stopped with RStudio only partially loaded. You can then
continue execution in lldb with `c` and the RStudio session will continue to load.
From here you can set breakpoints / interrupt execution as you normally would
when debugging with lldb.

While this process isn't _too_ cumbersome, it is certainly more work than is ideal, and
the workaround is somewhat esoteric. Luckily, RStudio 1.2+ (now available as a
[preview release][preview]) makes this extra workaround unnecessary! In v1.2 you _can_
attach lldb directly to a running RStudio session without causing RStudio to
fail!

Thanks again to Jonathan McPherson and Kevin Ushey for their pointers on how get this
working for RStudio 1.1.
